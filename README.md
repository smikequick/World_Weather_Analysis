# Vacation Planning

## **Purpose**

The purpose of this project was to leverage the Google Maps API to gather data on weather from over 2,000 random locations to determine best locations for a vacation based on weather. Based on this data, further information was gathered such as specific latitude and longitude coordinates to identify particular areas with an appealing climate, as well as hotels in those particular cities. From there, further analysis was done to create a map for directions to travel amongst 4 ideal vacation spots. 


##  **Results**

Leveraging the Google Maps API, data was gathered based on minimum and maximum temperatures to find "ideal" vacation locations between 75° and 90° Fahrenheit.

Based on this information, further details were gathered about a particular region of ideal vacation spots. From there, script was written to illustrate the travel information for those particular cities (e.g. hotel name, weather conditions, etc.).
